## ARCHIVED

Reddit has basically killed free third-party apps.
This basically means Helico died, not just due to lack of free time and other projects (which to be fair basically halted development anyway), but also due to factors beyond my control.
Reddit is dead, long live Lemmy / Mastodon?

Helico is another Reddit Client for Ubuntu Touch. While it relies on Lomiri QML Imports, the C++ code was designed to be at least somewhat OS agnostic, and should therefore be fairly portable to other (mobile) operating systems.
